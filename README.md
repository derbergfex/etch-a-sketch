# Etch a Sketch

This is a small front-end project for the ODIN Project curriculum of web development, the aim of which is to practice some DOM manipulation.
This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. 
You simply choose your prefered grid-size and color, and then hover over the board with your mouse.
